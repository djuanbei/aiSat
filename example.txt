#example 17

A = [x y z] # variables


#example 18

M= { 1 x y x^2 x*y y^2 x^3 } # monomial used in  unkown polynomial


f1=4*x^2-y^2
g=x-y
s=sos(M) # an unknown sos polynomial whose support is M (evey  momomial of s must occur in set M ),in orther words s =f_1^2+...+f_s^2 

cg=poly(M)# an unknown polynomial whose suppport is M

g*cg +s == f1 #solve a constraintd polynomails problem
